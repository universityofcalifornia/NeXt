  include CarrierWave::RMagick

  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "uploads/badge/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  def default_url
    "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fit => [120, 120]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end
